> EARLY DRAFT: This section still needs a lot more work before it is ready. Most things here will probably change before it reaches a publishable state.

# Budgeting

Budgeting \(all spending except salaries, which, for the first 10 partners will not be included in these budgets\) is done by the founders. The budgets will be quarterly and will initially be broken down into:

* Technical Infrastructure
* Marketing
* Business Development
* Community Outreach
* Security
* Rent
* Administration
* Design Resources
* Legal

One person will be responsible for each area of spending, and all related expenses should be approved by that person. They will also be responsible for reporting the expenses at the end of the quarter.

The budget will be internally public so all partners can see where the company resources are going.

## Expense Policy

* If it costs under $100 and it makes sense to you, just spend it.

  * No need to get approval. People need to get their work done and should feel empowered to spend under $100 to do so.
  * Bill it by going to the Google Doc expense form, copying it, filling it out, and sending it to Liz.

* If it costs more than $100, get approval from the Lead Link of your circle.

* If it is a recurring expense then as long as it is under $200 per year then no need for approval.
