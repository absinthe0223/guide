# Complaint Policy

OMALAB is committed to creating a safe work environment that is free of threats to the health, safety, and wellbeing of the people who work here. That includes (but not limited to) harassment, discrimination, violation of health and safety rules, and violence.

OMALAB has an open-door policy, so partners are encouraged to report work-related concerns. If something about your job is bothering you, or if you have a question, concern, idea, or problem related to your work, please discuss it with the founder you report to as soon as possible. If for any reason you don’t feel comfortable discussing it with them, feel free to raise the issue with any founder.

Any partner who witnesses or is subject to inappropriate conduct in the workplace should report it to the founder. We encourage partners to come forward with any workplace complaint, even if it’s not about something that’s explicitly covered in our written policies.

Once a complaint has been made, the founder will determine how to handle it.


# No retaliation

We will not engage in or allow retaliation against any partner who makes a good faith complaint or participates in an investigation. If you believe that you are being subjected to any kind of negative treatment because you made or were questioned about a complaint, report the conduct immediately to the founder.
