# Salary

The following policy will apply to all partners at OMAlab.

### **Salary**

Fair compensation is critical to making OMAlab a desirable place to work and helping our partners lead happy, healthy lives inside and outside of the office. When used as a motivational tool, though, it can incentivize the wrong kind of optimizations. Our goal with salary is that it checks the "enough" and "fair" box for folks who are excited about working at OMAlab \(because of the people, product, and opportunity for growth\) and then fades into the background.
