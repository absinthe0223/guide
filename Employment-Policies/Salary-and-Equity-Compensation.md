# Salary and Equity Compensation

The following policy will apply to all partners at OMAlab.

### **Salary**

Fair compensation is critical to making OMAlab a desirable place to work and helping our partners lead happy, healthy lives inside and outside of the office. When used as a motivational tool, though, it can incentivize the wrong kind of optimizations. Our goal with salary is that it checks the "enough" and "fair" box for folks who are excited about working at OMAlab \(because of the people, product, and opportunity for growth\) and then fades into the background.

### **Market Bias**

Traditional market salaries are heavily biased because they rely on individual gut feelings and negotiation. This favors candidates who come from more privileged backgrounds and are afforded more confidence during the hiring process.

To acknowledge and help counteract some of this bias:

* All current and historical salaries, consultant fees, stock options and cap table are internally transparent

* Everyone will have access to a third party professional negotiation and career coach


### **Equity**

Every offer also comes with the option to take less salary in exchange for equity. The earlier a partner joins OMAlab, the more equity they are granted for their salary exchange. The history of offers, and equity exchanges chosen is also transparent to partners and to people coming on board.

At the beginning of each quarter we will adjust the equity to salary exchange for new offers or raises to make sure it stays at market rate. Once a year, on the anniversary of their start date, existing partners may choose to change the percentage of their salary they are exchanging for equity \(at the same rate new offers are being made at\).

All new partners should also check out our [Guide to Your Equity](https://github.com/omalab/guide/blob/master/Hiring-Documents/Guide-to-Your-Equity.md), which walks through the nuances of owning OMAlab stock options.

### **Determining Market Salary based on Consulting Rates**

If a candidate has been consulting for over two years, we'll use an internal formula that compensates them for the opportunity cost of their consulting practice in order to calculate base salary. This formula takes into account billable\/non-billable ratio, the demand they have for their services \(both past and future\), payroll tax and benefits costs...etc.

### **Candidates from a Non-Profit Background**

While it's difficult to [get good data](https://nonprofitquarterly.org/2010/06/21/nonprofit-salaries-achieving-parity-with-the-private-sector/) on this, we think on average, non-profit salaries tend to be 5% to 10% lower than for profit salaries. For this reason, if a candidate is applying to us with a best recent market offer from non-profit we will adjust our rubric based on that.
