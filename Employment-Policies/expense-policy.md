# Expense Policy

Expenses happen. This is a framework for what expenses are acceptable, what are not, how you are paid, and when issues arise. 

As a partner, we expect you to:

* Behave honestly, responsibility, and with the guidelines of this policy \(i.e. keep costs low\)
* Submit expenses as soon as possible and with enough details to explain why the purchase was necessary 
* Keep all receipts and provide receipts \(not just credit card slips\), so we can reclaim taxes where appropriate.  

As a manager\/approver, we expect you to: 
* Check that purchases comply with this policy

* Approve them promptly

* Ensure they're claimed appropriately 


If a partner does not comply with this policy, we can delay reimbursement or reject claims. Persistent or deliberate non-compliance will result in termination.

We have a zero toleranace policy for bribery--in compliance iwht relevant anti-bribery lawas in all the regions we operate. Offering or accepting a bribe is simply not acceptable.  

Fradulent expenses or charges identiifed will result in immedate termination.
