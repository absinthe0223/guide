# Supplemental Policies for Bonuses, Commissions, and other Performance-based Payments

For partners that have a performance-component to their payments made by OMAlab, the following policies apply.  

All payment are based on performance of an established metric. 

Without an supplemental agreement, such as an Management by Objective Plan \("MBO Plan" or "MBOs"\) or Sales Commission Plan \("Sales Plan"\) that specifically defines the metrics of these payments, these payments are at the discretion of the CEO and company leadership.
