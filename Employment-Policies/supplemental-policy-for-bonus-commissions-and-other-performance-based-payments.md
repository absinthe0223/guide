# Supplemental Policies for Bonuses, Commissions, and other Performance-based Payments

For partners that have a performance-component to their payments made by OMAlab, the following policies apply.

All payment are based on performance of an established metric, and documented in a Management by Objective Plan \("MBO Plan" or "MBOs"\) or Sales Commission Plan \("Sales Plan"\) that specifically defines the metrics of these payments.

If a MBO Plan or Sales Plan does not exist, these payments are at the discretion of the CEO and company leadership.

When there is a dispute about the payment based on an MBO Plan or Sales Plan, what someone should be paid on, or whether the person as fulfilled the metrics defined in the plan, then the decision made by the CEO and company leadership is final and binding.

With or without a Sales Plan, if the monthly revenue produced from your sales on a monthly basis does not surpass your base salary, you will not be entitled to a commission payment. Your commission are only paid on the amount above your base salary.  

For Sales Plans, OMAlab pays commission payments based on sales recognized and received as revenue, and only on final, collected sales.

OMAlab will make payments within one pay period of receipt of funds by the customer\/client, in the case of Commission payments.

All commission payments \(or lack of payment\) will be considered final after 30 days.  No changes to payouts in favor of the partner can be made after 30 days.  The company reserves the right to make changes in the company favor for errors, omissions, and other items at any point the incorrect payment is recognized, up to three \(3\) years.
