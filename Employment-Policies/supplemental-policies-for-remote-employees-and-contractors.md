# Supplemental Policies for Remote Employees and Contractors

For contractors and remote employees, there are some additional policies that are required for you to be paid in full for your work at OMAlab.  

**You are budgeted at 7 hours per day of productive work. **

This means that you are expected to work that amount of time regularly and consistently, and at peak performance. Sometimes we might have to work more, but the plan is for you to work 7 hours per day. This is, of course, unless your contract is for less working hours\). 

If you are billing more than 30 hours per week, you are expected to be a FULL time person. This means you don't work other jobs outside of OMAlab.  

We manage you to 7 hours per day of productive work, because simply put it is not possible for a person to work 70 hours a week regularly and not burn out. So, given that we are expecting you to have a reasonable work schedule, this does NOT give you the right to add another 25 hours/week job on top of your work. It is expected you will rest and renew on other times\/days. 

To be clear, if we find you have abused this policy by taking other signficant work, you will be immediately terminated, and your final invoice will not be paid. 

**You must COMPLETE work to get your full compensation.**

You are paid to do work regularly and recurring. But, unless there is an exception, there will also be a bonus component to your compensation when you get work done requested of you. This is to ensure you understand that while we value you "working", we value more you COMPLETING more than working. This will be 10-50% of your total compensation. So, get things done. 

If you do not have this bonus component, and you choose to leave the company with unfinished work, and you do so without a graceful transition period as defined in your offer letter, expect that your last paycheck will be garnished to reflect the uncompleted work and lack of transition. 

**You will only work on items that have been assigned to you, unless otherwise instructed. **

You are not to "run up" your hours working on items that, while need to be done, haven't been expressly assigned to you. It's a common problem that we have, where a contractor ore hourly employee will run up their hours, continuing to charge for work that is "filler" work, and doing it slowly. This is totally unacceptable. 

It is YOUR job to ensure that your manager understands what you are doing, when you will be done, and when you will be free to work on something else.  Having a next job assigned to you is NOT an excuse.  

You will only be paid the hours you bill on items expressly assigned to you. 

**If you are hourly, you must supply detailed time\/task logs for every hour billed.  **

If you are paid on a monthly contract at a fixed rate, you MUST supply daily detailed time logs tracking the time of your actions and activities against assigned tasks. These items should account for at least 80% of your total billed time. If they are less than a 80% threshold, we reserve the right to adjust your invoice to the actual time worked on tickets and tasks.  

In both cases, it is not acceptable to submit daily time tracking for billing that has an undescriptive or generic generation of your activities. When this occurs, we cannot correlate your work to an actual task without significant effort on our part, it will not not be recognized as valid hours for the purposes of billing and payments. 

Ultimately, it is your responsibility to ensure your time tracking and billing shows the specific action and activities you worked on, submitted in a verifiable way. Without this, we cannot pay you for this work. 

And, failure to comply with this policy is grounds for termination.  

**You must give your manager a status at least once per day. **

You will update your manager daily on your working activities and how much time they took, estimated completion, and what you are scheduled to work on next. This can be delivered via email or Slack communication. 

**You will check in your work or code daily into our systems. **

At the end of the day, you will check in your work. This means that you sill sync it to one of our repos \(as a developer\), or copy your working drafts up to your Google Drive or Dropbox. If we find you are regularly NOT copying your work to our servers, this is grounds for immediate termination, as it is a best practice. 

**Your working hours will overlap substantially with the USA Eastern Time Zone working time. **

If you are a remote employee or contractor, and you are working with USA East Coast personnel, it is expected you will substantially overlap your working hours with the USA Eastern Time zone. It's understood you might be up early, or leave early, but you must overlap at least four \(4\) hours with the USA. 

In addition, no accommodation will be made for your working schedule. For example, if we need to have a client meeting that you will be involved with, and the client chooses to schedule the meeting at 4pm, it is expected that you will accommodate the schedule without complaint and attend.  

**You are responsible for keeping your computer and internet up to the tasks.**

As a remote contractor or employee, you are responsible for your own equipment and communication services. It is expected that you will keep these items operational so that they do not impact work and communications we are trying to have.

Our company regularly uses Google Hangouts for video to have meetings, and create a sense of team even though we are remote. If your system cannot support this, and we cannot hear or see you, you can't communicate reliably, or your setup always breaks and causes problems, then this is a significant detriment to the company overall.  

If these problems regularly occur, is is grounds for immediate termination. 

**Everyone gets sick. But, sickness is not allowed as an excuse. **

As a remote person\/contractor, sometimes you get sick. That happens, and we do NOT judge you on this. 

However, if you have a scheduled deliverable, it is CRITICAL that you reach your manager letting them know that you are sick and will not make your deliverable, and to provide a revised estimate. Letting your manager know AFTER you miss the deliverable that you were sick is grounds of immediate termination. 

In addition, regular absenses, especially around delivery times, is grounds for immediate termination. This is not an evaluation of whether you are truthful. We are required to get things done, and keep our manager informed. If your regular absenses impact that, then there is little else we can do. 

The same rule applies to "medical emergencies", family situations, and other things that cause people to be absent. 

**You cannot start without signing an NDA, Non-compete, Non-soliciation, and Intellection Property Agreements. **

Before starting work, you will be sent materials that you are required to exeucte. You will not be paid without these documents being fully executed and received by the company. It is YOUR responsiblity to ensure you have completed all these documents. 

**If you are working on UpWork or similar service, you are expected to bill your hours live \(no manual work\). **

We require all UpWork-based partners to use screen recording to record their screenshots. This is to ensure htat, as a remote, on demand contractor, we have a record\/log of your actual time being billed to us. 

The logic for this is simple: if you give us manual time, then we have to go back through all your work, and compare your billing to your deliverables, and try to estimate whether we have gotten what we are being asked to pay for. This is a lot of unnecessary work we have to do \(which costs money\), so you can have the pleasure of not having to track your screens. This is why we do NOT support this initially. 

Once we establish trust, we can enable  SOME manual billing. But, you must get approavl for manual time before starting to log manual time. Ify ou "have a problem" and "can't bill because of a problem" and need manual time, that will not be acceptable without showing us the logs of your request for help from UpWork technical support, and UpWork or similar's technical support stating that they cannot fix the problem.

If we transition away from UpWork to a direct relatioship, we will wire transfer funds to you. It's expected that we will remove any wire transfer fees from the amount we pay you, and you will continue to get paid the same amount. This is in your benefits, as there is a fee of up to 10% we are paying UpWork. The wire transfer fee will likely be less than this. 

Undersatnd that we will require to a modification to our schedule \(we won't pay you weekly\), to confirm with the payment schedules of other payments.  

It is at the company's discretion when any of these changes to your billing relationship happen.  

**If you billing is found to be in error \(times worked versus billed hours\), you will be terminated. **

It's unfortuatnely all too common that remote contractors fake\/load hours. If we EVER find you have done this, you will be immedaitely terminated. In additoin, to the fullest extent of the power we have, we will ensure that any thing party service we use, such as UpWork, is aware of the siatuation.  

If you need more work, ask for it. Don't fake your time. 

**These rules, and all decisions related to your employment and compensation are ultimately at teh discretion of your manager and the leadership of the company. **

The company has final decision-making authority on all matters. As a partner, and as a condition of your payment, you agree to this term.  While we will always attempt to be fair and reasonable, we have ot protect the interests of the compay first and foremost over your personal interests. 

**You agree to a third party arbitrator of the company's choosing to resolve matters that cannot be amicably resolved. **

As a conditon of your payment, you agree that should a dispute arise that requires a third party to resolve, the company may choose a neutral arbitrator to settle the dispute. Should the arbitrator rule in favor of the company, you agree to pay the for the arbitrator's time and expense.
