# Organizational Strategies

*Note to Staff:  This OMA Strategic Objective is the basis for all corporate and individual decision-making. This is NOT a trite mission statement that should be glossed over. Instead, the Strategic Objective gives an overview of the general strategy, describes our direction, who we are, and how we function. By following its guidelines, growth and success take care of themselves. In the spirit of simplicity, we limit the length of the Strategic Objective to one page. We modify it as necessary, just like we sharpen the tip of our arrows before we go hunting. *


## Progress competes with the status quo.

The world is full of status quo. Stuff that we put up with in our lives every day. Things that we need, but are just not painful enough to make a change. There are businesses that have a vested interest in maintaining the status quo - these are the incumbents. 


## Incumbents keep progress from happening.

It is in their interest. Incumbents have a vested interest in maintaining the status quo. They are doing well. They are maintaining or gaining. They have won. Why upset the apple cart? 


## We are not them. We are not the incumbent. We are the rebel, the upstart.

At OMA, we are NOT the incumbent. We are not the people that have it all in our pocket, clawing to keep our stuff. We are the rebel, the upstart. We are the people that, through hard work, ingenuity, tenacity, and luck, make thing better. 

**This is our mission at OMA, our duty--to progress marketing science, to make thing easier, smarter,  and more personal for our customers & their customers.**

How we do this is by building software that makes our customers digital marketing experts. 

Today, we primarily target users in medium to large businesses, with revenues greater than $200 million. Essentially, the Global 2000.  

Through intense commitment to our employees, we will contribute to the success of our clients. The consequence of having loyal, smart, hardworking, long-term, and well-compensated employees is superb quality service to customers. 

Our business is complex, with human, mechanical, and computer systems in simultaneous motion.  Success depends on refined communication and organizational systems, dedicated staff, documented point-of-sale procedures, first-class tools, rigorous quality control with continuous measurement, assertive innovation, intensive systems maintenance and improvements,  aggressive and measured marketing, and relentless attention to detail throughout the organization.  

Competitive advantages include custom-developed tools that simplify our work and make it measurable, products that are designed for the unique needs of our customers, thoughtful customer service that is immediate and consistent, and absolute personal/corporate integrity. We use extraordinarily efficient communication tools and protocols. We constantly refine and improve all internal systems to improve ourselves every time we deliver.  

To grow, we focus on two things.  First, we build "great" products.  Second, we aggressively market them.  Rapid growth ONLY comes from aggressive growth of our customer base.  And, we develop deep expertise in the areas of legal, medical, and high technology marketing. 

Although we tightly control OMA operations through guiding documentation, we will modify that documentation immediately if an improvement can be made: "Our operational framework is rigid, but that framework can be modified instantly."

We segment responsibilities into specialized "expert compartments" with appropriate cross-training among departments. We have backup personnel for all management and staff positions.
