# Tribe Agreements

## Org Space & Tribe Space

There are two distinct and complementary 'modes' or 'spaces' that we operate in. **Org Space** concerns itself with getting the work done. Moving the company towards its purpose tactically and strategically. Our [Operating Model](Operating-Model) spells out the details of our **Org Space** agreements. When operating in **Org Space** we intentionally put our personal tensions aside and step into our roles and function from there.

We are, however, much more than our roles. In our work together we are affected as people, not just as roles. In the course of working with each other, we impact each other. Toes get stepped on, feelings get hurt, friendships start and end. Misunderstandings. Attraction. Power struggles. You name it.

Our Tribe agreements are our attempt to deliberately address our interpersonal relationships, and care for them. In doing so, we are more able to fulfill our organizations' purpose.

For this reason, **every person takes on a secondary purpose: to co-create a thriving culture for our team that brings out the best in us.**

## Four Tribe Agreements

These are the agreements we keep in our daily work and interactions with each other and with our stakeholders in order to care for our Tribe Space.

### Act in Integrity

Speaking my truth clearly and authentically. Keeping my word. Calling out and repairing my mistakes \(even when no one is looking\). Choosing courage over comfort. Doing what's right over what's expedient or fun. Practicing the values I profess. Having good boundaries and honoring others' boundaries. Being reliable.

### Don't triangulate

The intention of this agreement is to build a low-drama, low-politics culture: A team where everyone is confident that they are respected and honored when they're not present.

Don't gossip. Don't build political alliances to get work done. If you mention someone's name when they're not present do it in the same way you would if they were present. If you have feedback for a partner, the best and only place for this feedback is to give it to them directly. If that's not working, get others to join the conversation.

If you have feedback for supporting staff, or other stakeholders, do your best to give it directly to them. If that's not possible\/efficient\/effective it's OK to talk about them with another partner.

### Clear personal tensions swiftly and directly

We are human. Personal conflicts will come up as we work together. When you feel that something personal is beginning to get in the way of you working optimally with another partner, **address it directly with them as soon as you can.**

We call this process "clearing a withhold".

A withhold is anything that I'm "holding" in my mind or heart, that's keeping me from feeling "clear" with you.

Withholds come in many different flavors:

* **A Pinch:** Something someone did, that "pinched" my ego. I could let it go, but it's building a small level of resentment, so I'll just say it. For example: "When you didn't respond to that question I asked in the meeting I felt snubbed". Pinches are quick to resolve, and usually don't need more than a "thank you" in response.

* **A Reality Check:** We make up stories all the time about each other. If you notice a belief forming in your mind about someone else, ask them about it. For example: "I noticed that whenever I talk about anything related to marketing, you seem to zone out. I'm starting to make up a story in my mind that you think I'm shitty at marketing. Is there any truth to that?"

* **A Reflection:** We can see things in others that they don't see in themselves. Sometimes it's important to make room for a reflection in order to clear the air between us. Reflections can be "negative" or "positive" feedback about how we are relating personally to someone. This is distinctly different from feedback about their work product. For example: "Your accent reminds me of this guy who used to bully me, and sometimes I notice myself mad at you for no reason." or "I really like your writing style. I've always wanted to write like that and sometimes I notice that I feel intimidated and jealous of you."


Sharing reflections in this way, and being heard, can often diffuse the withhold, and reduce its charge.

Another good use of sharing a reflection, is with regards to the Five Personal Practices. Because these practices are interpersonal, giving and receiving reflections from each other on our progress and the areas where we need to practice more supports them in staying alive.

If you tried to clear a withhold with someone and failed, use our [Conflict Resloution Process](Conflict.md) to resolve it.

### Hold Others Accountable

Our agreements are meaningless if we don't hold ourselves and each other accountable to them. It is crucial that we step up to violated promises, broken commitments and bad behavior. In doing so, we maintain our integrity, and support each other lovingly and firmly in doing the same.

## Four Interpersonal Practices

Our interpersonal practices are aspirational. By definition, we will not do them perfectly, or consistently. Our commitment is to practice, fail, and then return again to the practice. Reminding each other when we forget, and reflecting to each other as we progress.

### Practice Kindness

We treat ourselves and others with dignity, respect and an open heart. We assume good intentions and give others the benefit of doubt.

### Practice Whole Heartedness

We are present. Fully engaging our work. Mind, body, heart and spirit. We don't hold back.

### Practice Radical Responsibility:

We assume full ownership of our collective purpose and our role\(s\) in it. We don't blame or avoid. [We own our experience, and our emotions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lk_a2iWWoVQ&feature=youtu.be).

### Practice Being Real and Vulnerable

We are real with each other. We minimize bullshit and call people on it \(kindly\).

On the flip side of choosing radical honesty, we choose to be vulnerable. Vulnerability means choosing to be impacted by someone else's truth and being committed to [putting down our defenses\/reactions\/shame and to being touched\/moved](https://www.ted.com/talks/brene_brown_on_vulnerability?language=en).

## Best Practices for Work Behaviors

Over time, we've learned a lot about what creates the right culture. To that end, the best practices we all must follow, are:

### Propose solution, don't just point out problems

If “what do you propose we do?” would make sense as a response to something you’re about to say, stop yourself and revise your statement until it doesn’t. Many things at Audenti are messed up, and it’s your job to help fix them. But instead of just noting there’s a problem, push yourself to come up with a suggestion for how to improve things. Be part of the solution.

### **It’s NOT not your job.**

Whatever your title, your real job is to make Audienti a success. So be careful about saying “it’s not my job” – if “it” affects Audienti’s success, it is your job!

Take ownership. Seek to discover hidden projects and backstop them. Always be asking yourself what’s going on and whether it’s good. Trust your gut – if something looks broken, investigate even if everyone else is acting like it’s fine and you feel unqualified to voice a contrary opinion.

### **Focus on the biggest bang, not the biggest rock.**

Choosing how to spend your time is one of your most important and difficult jobs. Choose well and you’ll have a massive impact on our chance of success. Choose poorly and you might as well not be coming to work at all. Metaphorically, when you’re at the high stakes buffet line of life trying to decide what to eat \(i.e., work on\), resist the bread’s siren call. It’s right there in front of you, it’ll definitely taste good in the moment, but ultimately it’s unsatisfying.

Likewise in life, don’t fill up on tempting but unsatisfying small projects.

Always be asking yourself: “What am I working on? Is it the most important thing I could be doing? Do I feel urgency to complete it? Does the prospect of completing it excite me? Could Audienti succeed without it?” If so it’s probably not worth doing.

### **Your first iteration of anything sucks. Worse is better.**

It’s likely that your natural tendency is to be a self-critical, overly-analytical perfectionist. This comes from a good place, but don’t let it keep you from doing anything at all! First drafts are golden – put one out there as soon as you can, while you’re still embarrassed by how bad it is, and perfect it in public. It’s hard to subject something you think is incomplete to public scrutiny, but it’s the best way to to work toward something great.

By putting it in public, you get critical feedback. You can adapt and change based on real data. You can spot failures and fix them early. Instead of burying your head in the sand, and pretending its perfect.

### **Don't take on more than 5 projects, and complete them before start\/commit to something new.**

An “almost done” project is just as valuable to the company as a project you never started. So always be asking yourself “how has the world changed due to my work here?” If the world isn’t any different then you haven’t accomplished anything, no matter how hard you’ve worked!

### **There’s ZERO credit for being right.**

And, a ton of credit for being part of the solution. Stay cool. It’s not as bad as it seems. We’ve been through worse. In 6 months no one will care.

### **Being busy! = Making progress**

There’s so much going on at Audienti that there are unlimited ways to stay busy. But beware: just because you’re not on Facebook and are feeling busy and generally stretched thin and tired doesn’t mean you’re making progress!

### **Don’t make the same mistake twice.**

Mistakes and errors are a part of progress. It’s only from problems that we learn what needs to change. But, in making mistakes, ensure we close the door behind us... so that we don’t make that mistake again. That way, our failures move us forward, and don’t keep us spinning in a loop.

### Anything with 2 heads is a freak.

One person owns a task. Even if you need help. If two people are assigned to it, then its likely to not get done. So, either you own it, or I own it, but someone owns it.And, related, if it’s a conditional \(if something then something\), then it won’t happen. We either do it, or we don’t. We work with solid lines, and boxes.

### Write like a human, to a human, in English.

We all speak English. We write to each other and the rest of the world like we’d talk to each other. We explain things simply, because if you can’t explain it simply, then you don’t really understand it. The more awkward word usements and technobabble you use, the less sense you make. And, everyone knows it.
