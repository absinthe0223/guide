# Core Values

## The chaos will not be minimized.

Building anything great is messy, and Audienti is no exception. We are pursuing a results-maximizing strategy, not a chaos-minimization or comfort-maximization strategy.

Plus, if this thing succeeds, what we are today will be unrecognizable 2 years from now. So fasten your seatbelts and expect for some craziness and hard work. 

## It’s NOT not your job.

Whatever your title, your real job is to make Audienti a success. So be careful about saying “it’s not my job” – if “it” affects Audienti’s success, it is your job!

Take ownership. Seek to discover hidden projects and backstop them. Always be asking yourself what’s going on and whether it’s good. Trust your gut – if something looks broken, investigate even if everyone else is acting like it’s fine and you feel unqualified to voice a contrary opinion.

Things tend to look weirder as you look closer – turn over the rocks and find the worms squirming underneath. Then tell someone about it – a peer, your manager, a founder; if you’re not speaking up you’re implicitly saying everything’s good.

Whatever it is, don’t assume someone else will notice or take care of it. These are the stakes: Audienti will either become part of the fabric of the Internet, or it will go into the dark. Which one is up to you.


## Focus on the biggest bang, not the biggest rock.

Choosing how to spend your time is one of your most important and difficult jobs. Choose well and you’ll have a massive impact on our chance of success. Choose poorly and you might as well not be coming to work at all. Metaphorically, when you’re at the high stakes buffet line of life trying to decide what to eat (i.e., work on), resist the bread’s siren call. It’s right there in front of you, it’ll definitely taste good in the moment, but ultimately it’s unsatisfying.

Likewise in life, don’t fill up on tempting but unsatisfying small projects. 

Always be asking yourself: “What am I working on? Is it the most important thing I could be doing? Do I feel urgency to complete it? Does the prospect of completing it excite me? Could Audienti succeed without it?” If so it’s probably not worth doing.

Work on important projects – don't fill up on bread. This doesn’t mean you should be trying to do big projects in one go; instead, do them in small chunks by releasing your first drafts. But be aware of whether you’re taking a series of small steps toward achieving a big vision or whether you’re taking a series of unrelated small steps that lead nowhere. This is also about ignoring distractions – small projects are tempting when they float into your inbox: they’re new, exciting, and represent a welcome break from whatever hard thing you’re currently buried in. But don’t be tempted! In particular don’t be tempted by small projects that “seem easy” – they only seem easy from a distance. Once you start you’ll realize it was harder than you thought.

So focus on the biggest bang, not the smallest buck, because the smallest buck is bigger than you think. Finally, because working toward big projects is hard, it’s easy to find yourself saying “okay we should be working on X, but before we can we’ll do the ‘easier’ and slightly less important project Y”. If you find yourself saying something like this, eat the frog and just work on X!


## Your first iteration of anything sucks. Worse is better.

It’s likely that your natural tendency is to be a self-critical, overly-analytical perfectionist. This comes from a good place, but don’t let it keep you from doing anything at all! First drafts are golden – put one out there as soon as you can, while you’re still embarrassed by how bad it is, and perfect it in public. It’s hard to subject something you think is incomplete to public scrutiny, but it’s the best way to to work toward something great.

By putting it in public, you get critical feedback. You can adapt and change based on real data. You can spot failures and fix them early. Instead of burying your head in the sand, and pretending its perfect. 

In fact, right now you’re the dumbest you’ll ever be. When possible, postpone decisions until you’re smarter! You think you know what’s important now, but you don’t.

Also, if you only allow yourself to put stuff out there when it’s perfect, you’ll be much more tempted to fill up on bread. It’s much easier to write the HipChat response than it is to engineer the perfect way to advance the product / community.

Restrict yourself to output that’s perfect and you’ll end up doing only projects you can execute perfectly in one go, which will be exactly those projects that don’t matter. Finally, remember: we have nothing to lose! If we fail it will be because we didn’t seize the opportunity, not because we made too many mistakes. Ripeness is fail.

And, most importantly, ultimately, the feedback from the customer is the information we need to build a successful product. If you never ship, we never get that feedback. And, we go dark.  


## Take the roast out of the oven.

An “almost done” project is just as valuable to the company as a project you never started. So always be asking yourself “how has the world changed due to my work here?” If the world isn’t any different then you haven’t accomplished anything, no matter how hard you’ve worked!

Create change on the world by taking the roast out of the oven and finishing the job. This also means that the worst thing you can do is get a project to “almost done” and quit. But this is also dangerously easy! Both because it’s probably a lot more work than you thought to get from “almost done” to “done”, and because you now have much more information about how valuable the project is and perhaps it doesn’t look so enticing anymore.

But this doesn’t mean you shouldn’t give up on a bad project just because you’re close to finishing it – you should ignore sunk costs. What it does mean is that you should think carefully about how important a project is before you start so you don’t find yourself wanting to abandon it mid-stream in favor of what’s now clearly truly important. It also means you should consider releasing your “almost done” version as-is and perfecting it in public (if it turns out to need perfecting at all) – this way the world will have changed AND chances are the “almost done” version was better than you thought. Worse is better.

Finally, it’s far more valuable to take the roast out of the oven on one project than it is to get two projects to being “almost done”. So when working on a project, force yourself to ignore all the other interesting things you could be working on until the roast leaves the oven. Focus. Eat one frog at a time.


## Being busy! = Making progress

There’s so much going on at Audienti that there are unlimited ways to stay busy. But beware: just because you’re not on Facebook and are feeling busy and generally stretched thin and tired doesn’t mean you’re making progress!

Ask yourself: how, through my efforts, is the Audienti better/closer than it was a few days ago? Have I made things happen? Have I pushed things forward? Or am I offering opinions and making sure things don’t break? Am I pushing my own agenda for what should happen? Or am I reacting to what the world, and our customers, are throwing in my face? Am I eating the frog? Or just sharpening pencils? Do I need to lock myself in a room without Internet to actually get something done?

Think hard about that last one – big hard projects require long, uninterrupted periods of deep thought and work. You should spend most of your time working on a single project for multiple hours, either alone or in a small group. No phone calls, no meetings, no “urgent emails”, no “offering opinions on other stuff that’s happening”.
 


## There’s ZERO credit for being right.

And, a ton of credit for being part of the solution. Stay cool. It’s not as bad as it seems. We’ve been through worse. In 6 months no one will care.

But remember, though “staying cool” is difficult, it’s rarely enough! Don’t just “weather the storm”. Do something to fix the problem!

Finally, complaining is especially toxic during a crisis. Remember: you get ZERO credit for being right that things were busted, and a TON of credit for turning a crisis into an good outcome. So stay positive and look for one!


## You can sleep when you’re dead.

Working at startups is hard work. It’s not a 9a-5p job. And, we’re not the the type of team that has a lot of people sitting around looking for something to do. This means that you, as one of our team members, are CRITICAL to our success. It also means that YOU have the responsibility to get things done.  

We are closer than we’ve ever been. This is something I have said time and time again. The reason I say it isn’t though to say we’re not there--I say it because we have to push harder, bear down on the drill, and get through the wall. If you honestly don’t feel like you’re bearing down on the drill as hard as you can, then you’re frankly not working hard enough. 



## Eat the Frog.

When deciding what to do next, choose the thing you most don’t want to do. Chances are it’s the hardest and most important thing on your plate. Want to check your email? You’re avoiding some bigger ambiguous task that you shouldn’t put off. Want to chill and watch TV? Don’t do it. 

Doing big, important things in life / at Audenti is hard! Recognize the feeling of doing something good and hard and unnatural and learn to cherish it – you’ll accomplish big things by running into the spike, not going with the flow.

Life is a battle against the evil voices inside that tell us to give in and take the easy way out. Beat it back by sitting down to dinner to eat the frog. You’ll be happy you did. 



## Don’t make the same mistake twice. 

Mistakes and errors are a part of progress. It’s only from problems that we learn what needs to change.  But, in making mistakes, ensure we close the door behind us... so that we don’t make that mistake again. That way, our failures move us forward, and don’t keep us spinning in a loop. 



## Anything with 2 heads is a freak.

One person owns a task. Even if you need help. If two people are assigned to it, then its likely to not get done. So, either you own it, or I own it, but someone owns it.

And, related, if it’s a conditional (if something then something), then it won’t happen. We either do it, or we don’t. We work with solid lines, and boxes. 



## Write like a human, to a human, in English. 

We all speak English. We write to each other and the rest of the world like we’d talk to each other. We explain things simply, because if you can’t explain it simply, then you don’t really understand it.  The more awkward word usements and technobabble you use, the less sense you make. And, everyone knows it. 



## No one has time to figure out what you mean. Say it directly.

Being soft or caveating your statements doesn’t do anyone any good. All it does is open the door for confusion. If something is crap, call it that. If something needs changed, then say that (or change it yourself). 

No one has time to figure out what you mean. Say it directly so people clearly understand your opinion.   



## What do you propose? 

If “what do you propose we do?” would make sense as a response to something you’re about to say, stop yourself and revise your statement until it doesn’t. Many things at Audenti are messed up, and it’s your job to help fix them. But instead of just noting there’s a problem, push yourself to come up with a suggestion for how to improve things. Be part of the solution. 



## Deal with your issues face to face

If you’re feeling awkwardness / weirdness with someone, whether it’s a peer, your manager, or a founder, talk about it with them. Emphasis on the "with them" – go feel it right to that person’s face. Don’t talk about it with others first – and if someone comes to you to discuss a problem they’re having with someone else, your goal should be to get them to talk directly to the person instead of talking to you.

If you think you should talk to someone, the answer is YES. 


## It should be fun and rewarding, most of the time. 

Working at Audienti is hard, but it's important that it be fun too! We won't succeed unless we all do great work, and it’s impossible to do great work unless you’re feeling inspired and enjoying yourself.

But, it’s not all happy jobs. Sometimes, you have to do stuff that you find boring, or crappy, or otherwise unrewarding. You need to get that stuff done as well, because frankly you can’t grow flowers without manure.  

All the other ingredients are there – a big hard project to work on with other talented people! This doesn't mean “force yourself to have fun! Squeeeeze!!” It means “If you're not having fun, something's wrong and we need to figure out how to fix it”.

Like many things, the best way to cure a funk is to to talk about it. Over-communicate your feelings! Talk to your peers, your manager, the founder, get help! Don’t be sad.


## You were chosen. Now fulfill your destiny.

We’ve a small team. Everyone here was hand selected based on my belief about their potential. We believe in you, otherwise you wouldn’t be here.  

So now, it’s up to you. It’s time to be the rock star. It’s time to fulfill your potential. To get it done. To make things happy. To be the change you want and believe can happen. Make it happen. And, let’s make this thing the next big thing in Internet marketing.
