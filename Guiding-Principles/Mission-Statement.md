> “A true purpose always has ethical and moral content, which can be either implicit or explicit. It is a statement to which all members of the community can say with the wholeness of mind, body and spirit, ‘If we \(notice the plural\) could achieve that, then my \(notice the singular\) life would have meaning.’” ~ Dee Hock

# Purpose, Mission, and Vision

Our Purpose is to help our customer's grow their businesses by finding, engaging, and ultimately converting prospects into leads that become customers of their products and services. And, to help their customers find the right things for themselves that make their lives better.  Without it being about who can buy market share.

## Mission Statement

The mission of OMAlab is to provide businesses with the ability to reach their prospects cost effectively with the right message.

* Today, businesses spend a TON of money on paid ads that don't reach people actually interested in their products or services. This wasted ad spend is highly inefficient, and could be applied more efficiently. 
* Ad networks have turned a blind eye to this problem, as it's not in their economic interests. Up to 50% of clicks are fraduletnt, yet ad networks continue to make it harder to track and manage\/measure ad spend.
* Prospects have gotten more sophisticated, with "blindness" to things that aren't really meaningful and relevant RIGHT NOW to them. 

We fulfill our purpose by helping businesses reach their ideal prospects with real, true value.

We build software systems that make it easy for busineses to identifty nad reach their ideal prospects with something valuable to the target prospect.
