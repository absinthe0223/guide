OMAlab\/Audienti prioritizes health benefits, wellness and education, so it’s important that we offer our partners good medical coverage.  

Currently with the number of employees at less than 10 in the USA, OMAlab\/Audienti requires each employee to enroll for medical insurance individually. They will then submit the documents to accounting for reimbursement of expense. 

Audienti will pay up to 80% of you and your dependent’s health care coverage, up to $350\/month. 

To be entitled to this benefit, you must document your costs from the exchange or purchaser of your choice. In addition, should anything change regarding your benefits, in terms of a change in cost, you must notify Audienti and supply updated documentation of the revised costs.
