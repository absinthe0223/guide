## **Vacation and Sick Leave**

OMA\/Audienti have an Unlimited Paid Time Off \(hereafter referred to as PTO\) Policy. An employee can take as many vacation days as he wants provided that he is responsible for managing his time off and ensuring that his role is covered during their time off. Because the PTO is unlimited, there is no “banking” or paid out leave on leaving the company.
